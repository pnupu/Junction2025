# Wolt Meet by IV All Stars

**Leveraging AI to reduce the friction of planning group activities.**

## Full Project Description

### Overview

Wolt Meet is an AI-powered group activity planner inside Wolt. It is an exploration of a feature, which could be added to Wolt provided that Wolt is already offering services for purchase for consumers on it's platform. The feature was built since our team felt a strong need for it and saw the opportunities generative AI has with solving the problem on Wolt's platform.

Wolt Meet uses Wolt's rich behavioural data, real-time context (time, place) and local service inventory to remove the pain of deciding what to do together, while opening a new services-driven business area for Wolt, and diversifying both their business and brand. We aim for Wolt not only connecting people with food and things, but to other people too.

### The Problem

Deciding what to do with a group is surprisingly hard:

- Needs and preferences are complex, and often unspoken
- Finding events and services that fit everyone's mood, budget and timing is work
- Few want to carry the "planner" burden, so plans stall or default to the same safe option

As a result, people meet less, try fewer new things, and don't fully use the services and experiences their city offers

### Solution: Wolt Meet - how it works

#### 1. Create a Meet Group in Wolt

One person scans or shares a QR/link in the Wolt app. Everyone joins a shared Meet group in a few taps – the flow is designed to be as low-friction as ordering food

#### 2. Lightweight personas from Wolt data

Using past orders, spending patterns and location behaviour, Wolt builds a lightweight persona for each participant (e.g. typical price range, neighbourhood radius, food / time-of-day patterns). It is good to note that our solution would greatly benefit from more in-depth knowledge of the users.

#### 3. Agentic AI refines what's realistic now

An agentic AI combines these personas with current time, location and service availability to ask a few targeted questions to the group. Questions adapt to the context to find overlap in mood, time constraints and budget.

#### 4. AI-synthesised activity suggestions.

The AI then synthesises everything into a small set of complete, realistic plans that use services on Wolt and partner experiences: where to meet, what to do, which services are involved (tickets, tables, food, extras), and what it costs per person.

#### 5. Group choice and execution

Users vote on their favourites. Once a plan is chosen, Wolt helps make the activity a reality by minimizing friction and handling logistics: booking tickets, reserving a table or adding items to a basket and managing split payments.

### Value for users

- **Frictionless planning**: Minimal steps, no messy group-chat logistics. Figuring out what to do becomes easier, not harder
- **Feels "smart", not "AI-heavy"**: The intelligence stays mostly in the background; users just see a few good options that match their group.
- **More and better experiences**: People discover relevant services and activities they wouldn't have thought of on their own, without extra effort.

### Value for Wolt

- **Extends Wolt into the "what to do" layer**: Positions Wolt not only as a delivery/logistics platform, but as a social activity and services planner.
- **New services-led revenue**: Drives demand for services on the Wolt platform (restaurants, groceries, tickets, experiences) and enables paid placements or promoted recommendations.
- **User growth and retention**: A genuinely new use case (group planning) attracts new users and keeps existing users engaged between food orders.
- **Brand diversification**: Shifts consumer perception from "Wolt = food delivery" to "Wolt = the easiest way to decide what to do and then make it happen."
